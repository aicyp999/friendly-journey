# a friendly journey
startup project for my own projects with everything that is needed :)

## start-up new project
just have to change:
  - .uproject file name
  - folder name
  - go to `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` and change the FriendlyJourney by own project name
  - go to `Config/DefaultGame.ini` and change the FriendlyJourney by own project name

_if you want to remove completely the remote git repository link you can run `rm -rf .git` in the project root folder._
